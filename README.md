# Arduino-Uno-Serial-Communication
This project demonstrates serial communication between an Arduino Uno and a computer using a C program and the libserialport library. The provided C program can send commands to the Arduino Uno to control the built-in LED (turn it on or off) and read responses from the Arduino.
